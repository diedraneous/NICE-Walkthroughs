Nice Challenge (XP Cyber) Walkthrough
Envinronment: Pretty Safe Electronics (Protect & Defend Focused)
Challenge Name: Configuration Management Gone Awry
Type: Technical


//// Scenario: ////
An automatic configuration management tool was deployed on the network by the MSP (Managed Service Provider) and seems to have incorrectly set some of the network settings on some machines. 
Your task is to fix those settings so everyone can connect properly to the network.


//// ADDS Server -- Domain Controller ////
1. Deploy the ADDS Server
2. Log in using the following credentials: playerone/password123
3. Since it is not connecting to the Network, we will need to examine the networking settings
      a. Right-click the ethernet icon in the system tray and choose "Open Network and Sharing Center"
      b. In the Network and Sharing Center, Click on "Change Adapter Settings" on the left-hand side
      c. In the Network Settings window that comes up, right-click on the Adapter and go to "Properties"
      d. In the Properties window, double-click "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" to bring up the IPv4 address configuration
      e. Examine and compare the addresses - 172.16.10.66 is the current address - according to the chart it should be 172.16.30.55. The subnet is also wrong. It is currently 255.255.255.255 and should be 255.255.255.0. Lastly,
         the default gateway is correct. So no changes needed. 
4. Next, we need to fix it! To fix it:
      a. In the properties window you are currently in, change the ip address to 172.16.30.55 and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0. Then choose ok, ok on the next window, then close the two other open windows
      b. Wait a few moments - it should show as green


//// Fileshare Server -- FileShare ////
1. Deploy the FileShare server
2. Log in using the following credentials: playerone/password123 (you will overwrite the login prompt - and the password won't show you typing - don't panic! That's normal!)
3. Since it is not connecting to the Network, we will need to examine the networking settings
      a. Run ifconfig to get the current configuration
      b. You have two adapters. The first one, ens32 is your network adapter. The second one, lo, is your loopback
      c. 172.16.10.100 is the address for ens32 - it should be 172.16.30.100 (so close!). The subnet mask is 255.0.0.0 and should be 255.255.255.0. It is missing a default gateway. Everything else looks good.
4. Now, let's fix it!
      a. Run the following command to set the address: sudo ifconfig ens32 172.16.30.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
      b. The command breaks down as follows: sudo (gives admin permissions), ifconfig (interface configuration), ens32 (adapter), 172.16.30.100 (ip address), and netmask 255.255.255.0 (sets the subnet mask)
      c. Once the command has run, double-check that it worked by running ifconfig - if not, do it again, if it did, move on to setting the default gateway
      d. Next, set the default gateway using the following command: sudo route add default gw 172.16.30.250 ens32
      e. That breaks down to: sudo (admin permissions), route add (adds a route for routing/switching), default gw (specifies we are adding a default gateway route), 172.16.30.250 (the gateway address) ens32 (specifies which interface it will be added to) 
      f. Wait a few moments - it should show as green


//// Prod-Joomla Server -- Prod-Joomla ////
1. Deploy the Prod-Joomla server
2. Since this is Joomla, the commands are going to be a bit different
3. Log in using the following credentials: playerone/password123 (the password won't show you typing - don't panic! That's normal!)
3. Since it is not connecting to the Network, we will need to examine the networking settings
      a. Run ip -a to view the current configuration (the Joomla server uses ip instead of ifconfig)
      b. Notice that the output is basically the same as ifconfig
      c. As with the fileshare - the network adapter is ens32 and the loopback is lo
      d. The information in here looks to be correct - however, we will manually add the information to ensure it is good
4. Let's fix it!
      a. To add the address, do the following command: sudo ip addr add 172.16.10.100 dev ens32
      b. That breaks down to: sudo (admin permissions) ip addr add (command to add an ip) 172.16.10.100 (the address) dev ens32 (specifies the interface to add it to)
      c. Next, we will add the gateway: sudo ip route add default via 172.16.10.250
